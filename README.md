# Sudoku Game Written in C Using the SDL Library
## Description 
This program was written with the purpose of being used as an Honors Project for the course ECE 26400 at IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN. It was developed on Ubuntu, and currently only compiles and runs in a Linux environment.

The project is a simple implementation of Sudoku on the desktop. It still has a few bugs, but the general structure of the game and rendering system have been developed.

An extensive outline of the project was written on Workflowy. The outline can be viewed here: https://workflowy.com/s/G_6D.A0aZ94uUwG

## Installation
In order to compile and run this program, the following dependencies must be satisfied on your Linux distribution:
* The SDL2 library package. On Ubuntu-based distributions, this can be done with a simple "apt-get install libsdl2-2.0"
* The SDL2 development package. On Ubuntu-based distributions, this can be done with a simple "apt-get install libsdl2-dev"
* The SDL_ttf development library. On Ubuntu-based distributions, this can be done with a simple "apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev"

## Knowledge Resources
To learn the process of developing an application with SDL, I used numerous resources. These following were the most helpful, and I would like to extend a word of thanks to each of the maintainers of these resources.
* SDL2 documentation. https://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage
* LazyFoo SDL2 tutorials. http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/
* C Primer Plus textbook, 6th ed. https://www.amazon.com/C-Primer-Plus-Developers-Library-ebook/dp/B00GWLPX76
